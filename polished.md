# Introduction üåü

- **Presenters:**
  - Shuky ‚Äì Principal Software Engineer with a lengthy background in HCI / Big Data.
  - Divya ‚Äì Principal Machine Learning Engineer, <span class="important">bio?</span>
- **Overview:** Deep dive and become a power user with GitHub Copilot.

# Prompt Engineering Basics (Divya) ü§ñ
- **Prompt Structure:** Crafting effective prompts for targeted code assistance.
    - normal prompt: `Write a function that processes data`
    - improved prompt: `Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of the even numbers.`
    - why: The 'improved prompt' is better because it provides specific details about the function's input and expected output, guiding Copilot to generate more accurate code.
- **Iteration & Refinement:** How to improve and refine prompts iteratively.
    - normal prompt: `Create a web server that handles requests`
    - improved prompt: `Create a simple Flask web server in Python that responds with "Hello, World!" when accessed at the root URL.`
    - why: The 'improved prompt' is better because it specifies the framework (Flask) and the exact behavior of the web server, making the task clear and focused.
---
# Prompt Engineering Basics (Continued...)
- **Few-Shot Prompting:** Provide examples to guide Copilot's output.
    - normal prompt: `Generate a SQL query to retrieve user data`
    - improved prompt: `Generate a SQL query to select all columns from the "users" table where the "age" is greater than 30.`
    - why: The 'improved prompt' is better because it includes an example of the desired SQL query, helping Copilot understand the specific requirements and generate accurate code.

- **Chain of Thought Prompting:** Get step-by-step logical code suggestions.
    - normal prompt: `Sort a list of numbers`
    - improved prompt: `Write a Python function that sorts a list of integers in ascending order. First, implement a function to find the smallest element, then use it to sort the list.`
    - why: The 'improved prompt' is better because it breaks down the task into smaller steps, guiding Copilot through the logical process needed to achieve the final result.

---
# Prompt Engineering Basics (Continued...)

- **Negative Examples:** Demonstrating how to guide Copilot by showing what not to do, helping it avoid common pitfalls and errors.
    - normal prompt: `Write a function to calculate the area of a circle using a fixed value for pi`
    - improved prompt: `Write a function to calculate the area of a circle. Do not use the value of pi as 3.14; instead, use the math library's pi constant.`
    - why: The 'improved prompt' is better because it explicitly instructs Copilot to avoid a common mistake and use a more accurate value for pi, leading to more precise code.

- **Prompt Chaining:** Linking prompts to build on previous context and generate more complex code.
    - normal prompt: `Create a login form for a website`
    - improved prompt: `Create an HTML login form with fields for username and password. Then, write a JavaScript function to validate the input and display an error message if the fields are empty.`
    - why: The 'improved prompt' is better because it builds on the initial task by adding a follow-up step, guiding Copilot to generate more comprehensive and functional code.

# RECAP: Advanced Prompt Engineering & Copilot Hacks

- **Chain of Thought Prompting**: Break down complex tasks into smaller steps.
- **Role-based Prompting**: Assume a role to guide the model's responses.
- **Disambiguation Prompts**: Clarify ambiguous questions for more precise answers.

---

# RECAP: Real-World Applications

- **Code Generation**: Automate repetitive coding tasks.
- **Debugging Assistance**: Identify and fix bugs faster.
- **Documentation**: Generate comments and documentation for code.

---

# Best Practices

- **Iterate and Refine**: Continuously improve your prompts.
- **Provide Context**: Give the model enough information to generate accurate responses.
- **Use Examples**: Guide the model with few-shot examples.

---

# Common Pitfalls

- **Overly Broad Prompts**: Avoid vague questions.
    - *Example*: "Write some code."
    - *Why it's a pitfall*: The prompt is too general, leading to unpredictable and often irrelevant results.
    - *How to avoid*: Be specific about what you need. For example, "Write a Python function that calculates the factorial of a number."

- **Lack of Context**: Ensure the model has all necessary information.
    - *Example*: "Generate a function to process data."
    - *Why it's a pitfall*: Without context, Copilot may not understand what kind of data or processing is required.
    - *How to avoid*: Provide detailed context. For example, "Generate a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a list of their squares."

- **Ignoring Iteration**: Refine prompts based on the model's output.
    - *Example*: Accepting the first suggestion without review.
    - *Why it's a pitfall*: The initial output may not be perfect or fully aligned with your needs.
    - *How to avoid*: Review and refine the prompts iteratively. For example, if the first output is not accurate, tweak the prompt to be more precise and try again.

---
# Common Pitfalls (Continued...)

- **Overlooking Edge Cases**: Not considering all possible scenarios.
    - *Example*: "Write a function to divide two numbers."
    - *Why it's a pitfall*: The function might not handle division by zero or non-numeric inputs.
    - *How to avoid*: Specify edge cases in the prompt. For example, "Write a Python function to divide two numbers, ensuring it handles division by zero by returning 'undefined'."

- **Misunderstanding Model Limitations**: Expecting Copilot to understand highly specialized or proprietary code.
    - *Example*: "Optimize this proprietary algorithm."
    - *Why it's a pitfall*: Copilot may not have the necessary context or knowledge about proprietary algorithms.
    - *How to avoid*: Provide as much context as possible and be prepared to manually refine the output. For example, "Optimize this sorting algorithm used in our proprietary system, which sorts large datasets efficiently."
